        <h2 id="headline">Sabiha Gökçen's life journey:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>22<sup>nd</sup> March 1913</strong> - Born in Bursa, Hüdavendigâr Vilayet, Ottoman Empire to Mustafa Izzet Bey and Hayriye Hanım, both of whom were of Bosniak origin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1925</strong> - During Atatürk's visit to Bursa in 1925, Sabiha, who was only twelve years old, asked for permission to talk with Atatürk and expressed her wish to study at a boarding school. After learning her story and about her miserable living conditions, Atatürk decided to adopt her and asked Sabiha's brother for permission to take her to the Çankaya Presidential Residence in Ankara, where Sabiha would live with Atatürk's other adoptive daughters, Zehra, Afet and Rukiye. Sabiha attended the Çankaya Primary School in Ankara and the Üsküdar American Academy in Istanbul.
            <br>
            Atatürk gave her the surname Gökçen, meaning "of the skies". At the time, neither Sabiha nor anyone else could know that she would become the world’s first female fighter pilot. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5<sup>th</sup> May 1925</strong> - Atatürk took Sabiha along with him to the opening ceremony of Türkkuşu (Turkishbird) Flight School. During the airshow of gliders and parachutists invited from foreign countries, she got very excited. As Atatürk asked her whether she would also want to become a skydiver, she nodded "yes indeed, I am ready right now". Atatürk instructed Fuat Bulca, the head of the school, to enroll her as the first female trainee. She was meant to become a skydiver, but she was much more interested in flying, so she earned her pilot's licence. Gökçen was sent to Russia, together with seven male students, for an advanced course in glider and powered aircraft piloting. However, when she was in Moscow, she learned the news that her sister Zehra had died, and with collapsed morale, she immediately returned to Turkey, isolating herself from social activities for some time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1936-1937</strong> - As girls were not being accepted by the Turkish War Academies in those years, Sabiha Gökçen was provided, on Atatürk's orders, with a personalized uniform, and attended a special education programme of eleven months at the Tayyare Mektebi (Aviation School) in Eskişehir in the academic year 1936-1937. After receiving her flight patents (diploma) she trained to become a war pilot at the 1st Airplane Regiment in Eskişehir for six months.
            <br>
            She improved her skills by flying bomber and fighter planes at the 1st Aircraft Regiment in Eskişehir Airbase and gained experience after participating in the Aegean and Thrace exercises in 1937. In that same year, she took part in military operations at the Dersim rebellion and became the first Turkish female air force combat pilot. A report of the General Staff mentioned the "serious damage" that had been caused by her 50 kg bomb to a group of fifty fleeing "bandits" and she was awarded with a takdirname (letter of appreciation). She was also awarded the Turkish Aeronautical Association's first "Murassa (Jeweled) Medal" for her superior performance in this operation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1938-1964</strong> - She carried out a five-day flight around the Balkan countries to great acclaim. In the same year, she was appointed "chief trainer" of the Türkkuşu Flight School of the Turkish Aeronautical Association, where she served until 1954 as a flight instructor and became a member of the association's executive board and also held the rank of lieutenant in the Turkish Air Force. She trained four female aviators, Edibe Subaşı, Yıldız Uçman, Sahavet Karapas and Nezihe Viranyalı.
            <br>
            In 1940 she married Kemal Esiner, an Air Force major, but he died in 1943. She retired in 1955 and officially retired from flying in 1964.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1981</strong> Her book entitled "A Life Along the Path of Atatürk" was published in 1981 by the Turkish Aeronautical Association to commemorate Atatürk's 100th birthday.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>22 <sup>nd</sup> March 2001</strong> She died in Ankara, Turkey at the age of 88. Sabiha Gökçen is a source of inspiration for all female pilots in the world and her legend will continue to live with us.
